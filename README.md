# LumberJack Telegram Bot

I've created a bot for the LumberJack game on Telegram, available through the @gamee bot. If you've ever been frustrated by losing to a friend in this game, this bot might be your new best friend.

## Background

I made this bot after repeatedly losing to a friend in the LumberJack game on Telegram. I wanted to level the playing field, so I created this bot to play on my behalf. It only works on desktop devices, needing a keyboard and mouse cursor for control.

## Installation

To get the bot up and running:

1. **Clone the project repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeGeek2006/LumberJackGameBot.git
```
3. Open it in an IDE or navigate to the main directory.
4. Run `java Main.java` to start the bot.
5. Alternatively, create a JAR file and run it using `java -jar [filename.jar]`.

## Setup

To set up the bot:

1. Input the target score you wish to achieve.
2. Confirm the bot's initialization by inputting "Start".

4. Ensure your mouse pointer is positioned directly over the game character's head on the game screen.
